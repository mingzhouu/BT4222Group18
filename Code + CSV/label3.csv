For him to come out of nowhere and just randomly ask if we thought swimming is in the game tells me that after playing it, he must've seen that it is and that's why he did the poll.

If it wasn't, why would he create a poll literally 2 weeks before release to generate more hype just for us to be let down.

I have a strong feeling that swimming stuff is in, does that mean we can dive to the bottom of the black lake, meet mermaids and use gillyweed, i don't think so, again temper expectations lol

but if underwater exploration is in in then of course its a pleasant surprise :)",,52,comment,10k8ak1,1,2023,neutral

26,23/12/2022 23:45,j61sbaq,"After a LOT of research,this is what I have.
In order:

Yellow:Arresto Momentum,Glacius,Levioso,Fera Verto.

Purple:Accio,Depulso,Descendo,Flippendo.

Red:Confringo,Diffindo,Expelliarmus,Expulso,Incendio.

Light Blue: Disillusionment Charm,Lumos,Reparo,Rictusempra.

Three Dark Green: Unforgivables of course.

The rest are for Creature care and Room of Requirement,as seen in Showcase 2.

Essential spells are: 

First Row:Default Spell,Revelio,Protego,Stupefy.

Second Row: Oppugno, Ancient Magic,Alohamora,Petrificus Totalus.

I chose Expulso because Poppy is seen to use it in recent gameplay previews.The only other alternative is Reducto,seen to be used by Dark Wizards,which suggests to me we won't be using it.It's not Bombarda,because that spell is specifically for objects, and works the same as Confringo anyway.

Rictusempra should be the final Light Blue spell because the symbol is of a wand and feather coming out of it,with symbols to indicate movement either side,as if to indicate the classic tickling with a feather.Rictusempra is of course the Tickling charm,and the only way to get into the kitchens in the books is to tickle a certain object,so it HAS to be that one.",,1,comment,10l22om,1,2023,neutral

After casting the first spell (red one) twice. You can hear a a 'clicking' noise before casting Repulso. I believe that clicking noise to be either the changing of the spell with certain buttons on the controller.  But the HUD is hidden so we can't see it. Or the player tried to cast a spell with maybe a combo, but used the wrong button(s). I think so because you can also see a little animation with it. The character waves his wand in a way not associated with casting a spell and the character looks at his wand while he is doing that, almost like the wand is 'not working' and he is waving it, looking at it like 'why are you not working?'",,2,comment,tmwsu5,3,2022,negative

108,13/2/2023 15:30,i9assm3,"Now this is good marketing. Sure it wasn't action filled like the SoP video was but that wasn't the point here. Nobody expected them releasing a (20 minute) video in the first place, it was a nice suprise. Also a lot of people want to see the open word section of the game and reading the comments people love it so far.

IMO it would be a really good marketing strategy if they would give us a video like this every month or 2 until it gets released. There's a lot of things they could show us like this: outdoor at winter, dungeons, hogwarts at inside.

That and give us a release date early summer and i'm happy

I prefer this type of marketing instead when they show us a video in a event and then disappear for a year or worse show the trailer to the press and then we have to read what they saw. That's the worse one.",,2,comment,usjsx4,5,2022,positive

That being said, Cyberpunks downfall was due to the overhyped expectations that fans had that the devs didn‚Äôt seem to quell. And they spoke on mechanics that weren‚Äôt in the game. I don‚Äôt feel like the devs have over sold us on the hogwarts legacy because not only have they been upfront about what isn‚Äôt in the game (lack of quidditch being the most shocking) and ,at the end of the day, I don‚Äôt think theres anything all that different from other RPGs. We‚Äôve seen character customization, we‚Äôve seen open world exploration, we‚Äôve had games with dungeons and crypts to explore. Hell even the combat system is similar to something we see in nearly every rpg. The thing that makes this special is that its the WIZARDING WORLD. And they‚Äôve clearly delivered on that front.

Legendary gear is way too common and is worse than an uncommon item in most cases.  Most rpgs I‚Äôve played a piece of legendary gear can carry you about 5-10 levels above its level. 

I‚Äôm sure this part will come soon also but there‚Äôs no enhancements to gear in the beginning either so it‚Äôs just a higher number game. I would take a couple of points on offense for a piece of gear that increases damage spells 10% (or something similar).

the houses are about ""personality"" traits.

a ""heroic"" house like Gryffindor can have ""heroic"" type personalities but some of them could have had experiences in life that make them see things differently about the world.

and as this game shows, a House like Slytherin doesn't have to be chock full of ""evil"" people......they may have personality traits of a Slytherin, but be Noble and not trying to throw you under a bus JUST because they are Slytherin.....which REALLY really made me happy.
