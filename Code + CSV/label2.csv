If I were to give some constructive feedback however I would say it’s not the most accessible. The mix of dark colours, low contrast, thin lines and therefore small symbols makes it hard to see. I only have glasses, but if I take them off even from a short distance it’s almost impossible to pick out the icons! 

Again, lovely design but the accessibility could be something to guide future ideas!",,7,comment,ttkyky,1,2022,positive

Not to drag down your work but as feedback, I think the emblem for Slytherin looks a bit lost in the HL logo in comparison to the other two, though, whereas Ravenclaw's just looks tiny. If the emblems were in a similar style as Puff and Gryff's I think they'd look just as phenomenonal.

88,8/7/2022 0:40,i1ikqyv,"In regards to the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, I think it's possible that it could be Mrs Scamander (mother of Newt and Theseus).

From the wiki:

> The mother of Newt and Theseus Scamander **bred hippogriffs for a living** and **helped to inspire her son's lifelong interest in magical creatures**.

We see the MC riding a hippogriff in the SoP trailer and Mrs Scamander is said to have been born at some point ""before 1879"", so I'd say it's at least a possibility given the timeline.

It's also possible that she would be a fellow student instead (may be more likely actually since Newt would have probably mentioned it if his mother was the CoMC professor), but whatever the case may be, I would expect her to at least make an appearance.

And before anyone points it out, yes, I would also prefer that they create entirely new characters instead of trying to tie everyone to someone we've already heard of, but if the timeline adds up and it makes sense to have someone we know fill a certain role, I don't see why they should deliberately try to steer around it.",,4,comment,tj8sbt,3,2022,neutral

I've been excited about this game since we first found out. Im acting like Im 11 and just got my letter. My wife and my body remind me how old I really am lol. Everyday I turn on my PS5 I go to my preorder for Hogwarts Legacy and I watch the countdown timer for a little bit, just wishing the game was out and never got delayed. Watching the movies plus deleted scenes now, then I will listen to the audiobooks.... the Stephen Fry audiobooks. I like his best.",,4,comment,ztecaz,12,2022,positive

And most crucially. They are MEGA fans of the franchise and series. Of the wizarding world. Yeah that's not to say that devs don't get excited about their projects often. But it usually takes a backseat to the corporate arm. 

But Avalanche is showing some next level attention to detail, and pulling out all the stops. That state of play floored me. From the 2020 trailer I thought. ""Oh cartoony graphics more on the order of Hogwarts mystery"". Then they dropped that state of play. And they continue to blow me away ever since. Now all the sudden it's getting mentioned in the same breath as Rdr2 and Witcher 3. Hell that Sebastian sallow trailer was all optional side content. They have already since surpassed that original leak in 2018. Minus perhaps environmental destruction. But for all I know they've ported to Ue5 for next gen and PC to take care of those features. I haven't seen the game in it's finished state so I can't say for certain. 

The fact is I have never seen this level of studious craftsmanship from such a small team. Before then I'd have said no way. I'm cautiously optimistic of franchise games naturally. But I don't doubt this game being something magnificent on release.
