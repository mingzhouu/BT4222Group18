Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've heard one of the devs say that we are start our journey in the summer to catch up to classes because we start as a 5th year. Now summer could be june-august. Lets assume it is in August. So either in my opinion, for some reason we go away to London (maybe the bank?) for a reason while something happens in Hogwarts or we start our journey in Winter. Feb?

Of course not. Were there issues, sure, but is Cyberpunk a bad game? Definitely not. Given, I played it on PC with an RTX 3080, and that is a privilege a lot of people don't have.  


The biggest issue was that people wanted it to be way more than it ended up being. Is Hogwarts Legacy looking to be a good game? Yes. Will it live up to the hype? Unlikely.

244,31/1/2023 6:18,j2vnvxh,"You‚Äôve got it all wrong, and sadly you‚Äôre contributing to spreading misinformation. Can‚Äôt blame you though, most people don‚Äôt actually bother to look into the claims they make.

CDPR didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpromise so much‚Äù with Cyberpunk. They did their usual marketing, as all companies do, but it was the community that created inflated expectations about what the game would be, as the always do, and just like this community is doing with Hogwarts Legacy.  

Go watch any of the Cyberpunk trailers or game play walk throughs prior to launch. They didn‚Äôt over promise any more than any other developer (but conveniently ‚ÄúCDPR bad‚Äù I guess if it works to make your incorrect point).

You can even look up the famous German mistranslation about features in Cyberpunk from a poorly translated interview that got spread around Reddit as things that were ‚Äúdefinitely in the game‚Äù, or how they announced way ahead of launch about cut content, yet somehow that got turned into them ‚Äúlying‚Äù. 

You should actually look into what CDPR claimed cyberpunk would be, instead of just regurgitating whatever you hear online. 

Sadly, the cycle will just repeat, as I‚Äôve seen some ridiculous claims coming from this sub Reddit about what people expect or what they‚Äôre ‚Äúso sure‚Äù will be in Hogwarts Legacy.

Finally, you seem to conflate excitement with expectation, as everyone on this sub seems to, and I can‚Äôt figure out how this came to be. 

It‚Äôs perfectly fine to be excited about something. Many of us are excited for Hogwarts Legacy. 

it‚Äôs Not fine to expect unrealistic things, and this sub is expecting unrealistic things from this game. Far too much chatter has been around this being ‚Äúthe game I‚Äôve waited so long for‚Äù, as people said the same thing about Cyberpunk. 

Or, how about that Reddit thread where the OP claimed that the AI in Hogwarts Legacy was the most dynamic and advanced ever? 

How about the people who are straight up expecting to murder class mates GTA style?

Or that ridiculous YouTuber who expressed how disappointed he would be if he can‚Äôt read many books cover to cover in the library.

Not to mention that this is  Avalanche's first attempt at a modern ""AAA"" game as a pretty small team. It's a big ask however you look at it. But this has nothing to do with revolutionary new tech!!

This is just unfortunately the state of video game development these days. Releasing unfinished buggy messes has gotten more and more common over the years as developers are less and less inclined to get it right the first time on release date by just patching things months down the road.

I always get downvoted for saying this bc it goes against the grain of this subreddit with the hype of the game, but it's for this reason exactly why preordering games AT ALL is detrimental to the industry and is a big part of why game consumers have lost faith in the developer's ability to get things right the first time.

I recognize this game will be a very emotionally charged purchase so people will be happy even if it is a buggy mess, but please:

You can still preorder the game AFTER reviews have come out, get your bonuses, get your early play time, and still give developers the message that players aren't inclined to blindly pledge to purchase a game no matter how low quality it is.",,11,comment,102tom9,4,2023,negative

Elder scrolls online is my only mmo and Horizon was the most Sci fi I went. 

Most of my games have been the magic, thief, warrior type fantasy. Which this game falls under that AAA action rpg fantasy game umbrella. 

So to me the types of games and releases people should be basing this game of of are games in the same genre or of the same type. 

Now idk much about cyberpunk but I have no idea why that is the game everyone is basing expectation off of. 

The creators of cyberpunk have nothing to do with hogwarts legacy, they are different genres, and have nothing that links them.

**Margalo Forrester** ![img](emote|t5_q8ebh|26541)

Comes from a family of tree farmers, but has always yearned to be something more.  While she couldn't experience all seven years of Hogwarts like her older Slytherin ![img](emote|t5_q8ebh|26539)sister, Seyma and oldest Ravenclaw ![img](emote|t5_q8ebh|26540) brother, Leland, she is looking to make the most of the opportunity she has to learn from Hogwarts and find her own calling to make her mark in the Wizarding World.

One thing Margalo struggles with is telling lies, whether to keep secrets or talk her way out of situations, due to being paranoid that others can easily see through her dishonesty almost immediately.

That's not to say she is *completely* dis-trustworthy. She's always willing to help when it matters and is a Hufflepuff through and through.

325,2/3/2023 9:57,j7ogwmd,"I have the opposite opinion.

By having every door be openable...the castle feels knowable, and therefor the mystery is gone.

It's also just that we KNOW there is more castle, because if this was all the castle the whole 7 years of classes and teachers and classrooms wouldn't make sense.

I wish some of these Atriums and Grand Staircases had doors and areas that felt like they weren't for me. Instead every door is directly related to my story...and I just find that misses the mark of the context of what Hogwarts SHOULD feel like...which is unknowable, changing, and vast.

As I've played more, the locked doors and puzzle doors unveil more of the castle than you'd think...it's just kinda dumb that they are not accessible to us as if they were used spaces.

Like, why would a classroom be behind puzzle doors that are just arithmatic puzzles?",,-12,comment,10w9l35,8,2023,neutral
