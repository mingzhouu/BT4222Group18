My thought was it would depend how combat works. I would assume you just can't cast spells at teachers and classmates? Not sure but I would assume they just limit that entirely. 

In terms of combat balance, away I thought which I think sounds cool is making a spell weaker if you spam it. Different spells could be more or less effected by this. So Avada Kedavra would be after casting it once but Stupefy could be casted freely. In terms of the spell being weaker maybe it has a lessened effect or maybe it's easier to block.

216,2/8/2023 6:01,j8c6p9y,"So many spots for a little portal or hidden staircase. 

The dark Arts tower is a masterclass in using space poorly. It's like 90% staircase and big hallway...where are the rooms and connectors? 

Soooooooo much of this game is atrium with no connected rooms. It's so fuckin weird. 

Like...the ENTIRE SECOND FLOOR OF TEH DARK ARTS TOWER IS JUST HALLWAY....what?!

Especially when a lot of the castle isn't even connected to other parts of the same building. 

Like ...you can't even see through the windows so they can do mostly whatever the fuck they want. 

Not sure why they made it so difficult to get around. 

Like you're telling me the hall of herodiana just goes in and out of a building and never connects to the actual core of the building? 

Also what's with SO many stairways to nothing....it's a videogame. Any door can lead to any place.

In general I feel the dungeons were super underutilized as well.


Like if there is one castle in all of gaming where a door can lead into a pocket dimension that doesn't line up with the exterior ..it is this castle.


If we can't even see outside...what's the fuckin point of lining it up?

The few times we do get secret areas it's just chest filler....or worse...a wall for the Hall of Herodiana side puzzle....like they made a whole ass room...so I could go into a wall to some generic cookie cutter room to do the actual puzzle?

Another example. Why is there no interior pathway between the history classroom area and the dark arts tower? They are one contiguous building but the only way between is the Transfiguration courtyard. Or go all the way around and up the exterior staircase through the pungent passage. 

Like not even a secret closet doorway or side staircase? The entire building is hallway?!

Also entire floors of buildings are like...one room and a staircase. It's just weird. 

Why make this big countryside when so much of the castle could still be expanded?

Ill hope a dlc builds it out more or the accrued assets from this game will help them in building it bigger in UE5 for the sequel.

Shame the hall of herodiana takes up so much wall space...lot of those could be used to connect to more castle for dlc. Now it's just this big fuckugly marble empty wall.",,4,comment,110tcfb,2,2023,negative

At the same time, I don’t think very mild romance would have been a problem and it could have been rather sweet if done right. A good romance story doesn’t even need the characters to kiss (Pride and Prejudice!). Who doesn’t find the Stranger Things romances rather endearing and sweet to watch unfold, even as an adult? 

So maybe a little disappointed? But at the same time, if the companion friendships are well fleshed out then this may well fill that gap just fine.",,439,comment,10te7cx,4,2023,neutral

246,1/9/2023 2:46,j2vek6z,"Definitely completely different scenarios. 

This game has shown off a decent amount and isn't promising more than what they've shown, they've actually tried to contain hype by answering questions. What is and isn't in the game, what you can expect from the world, etc. They're not even saying don't be hyped because I absolutely am, it's just looking like a pretty standard action adventure RPG, and that's not a bad thing. 

With Cyberpunk they oversold and underdelivered hard. But most of that is because of upper management. We now know they were crunching hard this whole time, it seems like the vision changed while it was in development, and by having to also make it for last gen systems they couldn't fully take advantage of the new systems and mechanics. Even at launch we still didn't really know what the game was trying to be. 

That's not happening with Hogwarts Legacy. The game has a clear vision and goal, the gameplay is defined to what they want, the world is how they envisioned it and every little detail looks like a love letter to the franchise. It's looking like a very solid game that at the very least is gonna be great. 

The only way people will be disappointed on the level of Cyberpunk is if they go in expecting this game to be something it was never said to be. As long as you're not worrying about why parrying creates a bubble over you, this game is looking to be a fun experience that's worth the hype.",,84,comment,102tom9,4,2023,positive

It'd be one thing if it was locked but as far as I can tell (granted I didn't look till chapter 3) you can just sneak passed the goblins or run and access it. 

So why we can't just fly over is beyond me and the inability to fly contiguously over the whole map kinda blows...having that chokepoint just forces me to teleport to access the other area.

They have an RPG leveling system ..use it to region lock...idk why you need this choke points that undermines the fluidity of the map once you get passed it and are the right level. 

I wanted an immersion run with little fast travel but this game feels antithetically opposed to that concept. 

Hopefully the second game has more creative ways to lock off areas. 

My biggest wtf is still Forbidden Forest. 

It's so tiny, filled with nothing but filler to the brim which makes it feel unmysterious and conquered....in the books and movies it looked wild and limitless. They should have had it go to the map border and continue onward blocked by powerful enemies. 

Also they shouldn't have let us fly over it....destroys the entire element of it being imposing if I can just fly right to my objective and ignore the whole layout.

I have no idea what game could possibly knock Hogwarts Legacy from the spot. I can’t think of any other games this year that I think will be better. I mean, you know, CoD or Fifa or whatever always do well but those don’t usually win awards right? 

I am just so blown away by the detail and clear love for the franchise this game has. Imagining a sequel (hopefully in another country and another school, eventually loop back to Hogwarts after a few games) expanding the world building and improving on the mechanics when this game is already so amazing… it blowsmy mind.

I feel like a little kid raving about the new toy. I’m in my 30s. Been such a long time since I played a game that was *this* good. Maybe Horizon Zero Dawn or Breath of the Wild?

Edit: Should have read more, Tears of the Kingdom and Spider-Man 2. But even then, those are sequels so probably won’t be as new, novel, and mind blowing, although they would be strong contenders for GOTY.",,0,comment,10ywbmy,11,2023,positive
